Compile the daemon with:  make wacd 
Compile my_clock.c with:  make my_clock
Compile silly.c    with:  make silly
Compile standard.c with:  make standard
Compile shutdown.c with:  make shutdown

Remove all executable files with: make clean


Run wacd:  wacd [port]

wacd will prompt you to response (y/n) 
If you want to run in port writing mode (writing to /dev/port)


In wac.h I have set the MAX_CONNECTIONS = 3,
meaning that in wacd.c, the daemon gives exclusive access
to 3 clients.  This means that a client must disconnect
run wac_finish(), before the next client can connect.

Since my_clock, silly, and standard only call wac_finish(),
I created the shutdown program which calls wac_shutdown() which
shuts down the daemon entirely.
