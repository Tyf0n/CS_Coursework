Here is the output for our fairness experiment.  The experiment sets up the differing topologies and compares how the Ethernet is at serving equal bandwidth to its hosts.

Here are the three topologies involving 6 Hosts:

Topology 1:

Hosts 0-4 are on Repeater 1
Host  5   is  on Repeater 10 (10,000 feet away from Repeater 1)

Topology 2:

Hosts 0-5 are on Repeater n+1 (one Host per repeater, Repeaters separated by 1000 feet)

Topology 3:

Hosts 0-4 are on Repeater 1
Host  5   is  on Repeater 10 (10,000 feet away from Repeater 1)
